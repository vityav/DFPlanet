# DFPlanet
Turn dwarf fortress worlds into planets.

## Requires
* Python
* Matplotlib
* Visvis
* Scipy if you want smoothing capability

## Running
Edit dfplanet.py to change the two png filenames to those of your surface features and elevation map. Then run

`python dfplanet.py`

Once the figure finishes rotating, close the window. There's  probably a better way to do this but I don't know it yet.

## Notes
If you know visvis better than me (not hard, since this is the first time I've ever used it), please submit forks or issues to make improvements. Since, as pylint points out:

`Your code has been rated at -10.00/10`
